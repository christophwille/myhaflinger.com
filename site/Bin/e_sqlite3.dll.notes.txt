In an ASP.NET Web Pages project, the x86 and x64 folder are *not* copied automatically on build

x86 dll location: packages\SQLitePCLRaw.lib.e_sqlite3.v110_xp.1.1.2\runtimes\win7-x86\native

Also, in web.config a target platform needs to be specified in <compiler>, plus manually copy the respective native dll to /bin root

Deployment note: if using x86 compilation, set the app pool to 32 bit
